Requirements:
-------------

- Autodesk 3ds Max
  To build the COLLADAMax plug-in you need to have a version of 3ds Max, including the SDK, installed.
  Supported versions are:
  3ds Max 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015

- MS Visual Studio 2013

(optional)
- GIT comand line tool in your path. This is used by script\create_version_info_h.bat to create include\COLLADAMaxVersionInfo.h file in the COLLADAMAX prebuild


Building:
---------
Before you can start to build you need to set an environment variable that points to the MAX SDK

The variable is MAX_SDK_PATHXXXX with XXXX replaced with the version of 3DSMAX you want to build for.

For example:

MAX_SDK_PATH2012=C:\Program Files (x86)\Autodesk\3ds Max 2012\maxsdk

would be the value for a 2012 default installation. 

remember to set the variable before launching visual studio, preferably using the 

Then selet the corresponding build target in visual studio

Release or ReleaseStatic or Debug or DebugStatic for the correct version of 3DS MAX.
